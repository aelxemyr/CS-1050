 The "Dice Game" is an interactive program through which the user plays 
 a game involving two fair,  six-sided dice. Upon initiation, the 
 program will be give the player a fixed amount of tokens, referred to 
 as their "initial stake." Each round of the game costs 10 tokens, and 
 the player may continue to play additional rounds until their stake 
 falls below 10 tokens. The player is prompted to play a round, and 
 after they agree, the dice are rolled (referred to as the "comeout 
 roll") and their face-up values are summed. If the sum of these values 
 is 7 or 11, the player wins the round and their stake is increased by 
 20 tokens. If the sum is 2, 3, or 12, the player loses the round and 
 the round is over. If the sum is any other value, this value is 
 established as the "point" and the dice are then rolled as many times 
 as necessary until the value rolled is the point or 7. If the point is 
 rolled, the player wins the round and their stake is increased by 20 
 tokens. If 7 is rolled, the player loses the round and the round is 
 over.
