Getting started

All of the files necessary to play the Dice Game are contained in the 
dicegame.zip file, which must be unzipped. In order to start the program, 
open a command line interface and find the directory to which the game 
files were unzipped. Enter the command “java DiceGame” (without quotes); 
this will start the program.


Gameplay

Once started, the program will prompt you to choose a user interface 
(UI). By default, the game utilizes a dialog-based UI, and thus will 
prompt you via a dialog box. Once this preference is chosen, the game 
will continue in your chosen UI.

The “Dice Game” is a game played with two fair, six-sided dice. Each 
round is played by paying 10 tokens. In each round, the two dice are 
rolled and if their result is a 7 or 11, the player wins. If the result 
is a 2, 3, or 12, the player loses. If anything else is rolled, that 
value is established as the player’s point for that round and the dice 
are rolled again until either the point is rolled or a 7 is rolled. If 
the point is rolled, the player wins. If a 7 is rolled, the player loses.
