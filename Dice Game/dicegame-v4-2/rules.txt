The ''Dice Game'' is a game played with two fair, six-sided dice.  
In each round, the player places a bet and the two dice are rolled. 
If their result is a 7 or 11, the player wins. If the result is a 2, 3, or 12, the player loses. 
If anything else is rolled, that value is established as the player's point for that round 
and the dice are rolled again until either the point is rolled or a 7 is rolled. 
If the point is rolled, the player wins. If a 7 is rolled, the player loses.
