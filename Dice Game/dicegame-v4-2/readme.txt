------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The "Dice Game" is an interactive program through which the user plays 
 a game involving two fair,  six-sided dice. Upon initiation, the 
 program will give the player a fixed amount of tokens, referred to 
 as their "initial stake." The player is then prompted to place a bet and 
 roll the dice, and their face-up values are summed. If the sum of these 
 values is 7 or 11, the player wins the round and their stake is 
 increased by however much they bet. If the sum is 2, 3, or 12, the 
 player loses the round and the round is over. If the sum is any other 
 value, this value is established as the "point" and the dice are then 
 rolled as many times as necessary until the value rolled is the point or 
 7. If the point is rolled, the player wins the round and their stake 
 is increased by the amount they bet. If 7 is rolled, the player loses 
 the round and the round is over.
